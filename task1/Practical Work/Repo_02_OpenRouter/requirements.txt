# These are assumed custom/local or installed via a specific source
# So you may need to handle 'agents' package separately, if it's not public

# If 'agents' is part of your local project, do NOT include it here.
# If it's a pip package or GitHub repo, use:
# git+https://github.com/your-username/agents.git

# Optional: pin a specific version of Python if needed
# python>=3.9,<3.12
