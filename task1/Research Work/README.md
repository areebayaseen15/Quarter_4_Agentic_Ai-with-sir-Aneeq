# 01 - Research Task: Understanding Agentic AI and OpenAI's Agents SDK

## 🧠 Introduction

This document summarizes research on the basics of Agentic AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, and OpenAI’s Agents SDK. The aim is to build foundational understanding without diving too deep into technical details.

---

## 📌 What are LLMs (Large Language Models)?

Large Language Models are AI systems trained on massive text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include GPT-3 and GPT-4. They work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on context, which makes them capable of:

- Answering questions
- Writing essays or code
- Translating languages
- Summarizing content

---

## ✨ What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to AI that **creates new content** such as text, images, music, or even code. It includes technologies like:

- ChatGPT (text)
- DALL·E (images)
- GitHub Copilot (code)

It focuses on **generating outputs** from learned data patterns.

---

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is a step beyond Generative AI. It involves **autonomous agents** that can:

- Make decisions
- Take actions toward goals
- Use tools (APIs, memory, functions)
- Maintain long-term memory and goals

### 🆚 Difference: Generative AI vs. Agentic AI

| Aspect | Generative AI | Agentic AI |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Focus | Content generation | Goal completion |
| Autonomy | Reactive | Proactive |
| Memory | Short-term (contextual) | Long-term (persistent) |
| Tool Use | Limited | Can use tools & APIs |

## 🔧 OpenAI’s Agents SDK

### ✅ What is it?

The Agents SDK by OpenAI allows developers to build **goal-driven AI agents** that can:

- Use tools like APIs and custom functions
- Retain long-term memory
- Execute multi-step tasks autonomously

### 🚀 Why are we using it?

- To go beyond simple chatbot experiences
- To create intelligent assistants that can **act**, not just **respond**
- To build AI experiences that are persistent, contextual, and tool-using

### 🌟 Key Benefits

- **Tool Use**: Agents call APIs or functions dynamically
- **Memory**: Store and recall long-term context
- **Autonomy**: Complete multi-step tasks with reasoning
- **Secure Hosted Runtime**: Runs safely in OpenAI’s infrastructure
- **Developer Friendly**: Simplifies the agent creation process

## 📝 Summary

In this task, I explored the basics of LLMs, Generative AI, and Agentic AI. I also researched OpenAI’s Agents SDK to understand how it enables the creation of autonomous agents. This foundational knowledge will help in building intelligent, goal-driven AI applications.
